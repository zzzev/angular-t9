	<h2>Forward</h2>
	<p>
		"T9 word" allows you to input words quickly on a cell phone using only the 9 standard number keys.
		Each number represents several letters, except 0 and 1 which have no letters.
		The number 2 goes with ABC, 3 DEF, ..., 7 PQRS, 8 TUV, and 9 WYXZ.
		The usefulness of T9 is that you only have to press a given number once per letter in a word you want to type,
		and the algorithm can figure out which of each number's letters you intended based on the possible words your number combination could represent.
		For example, the number 7687 could represent both SOUP and ROTS:
	</p>
	<p class="example">
		<em>SOUP</em>: 7 [PQR<em>S</em>] 6 [MN<em>O</em>] 8 [T<em>U</em>V] 7 [<em>P</em>QRS]
		<br /><em>ROTS</em>: 7 [PQ<em>R</em>S] 6 [MN<em>O</em>] 8 [<em>T</em>UV] 7 [PQR<em>S</em>]
	</p>
	<p>
		The point is that T9 can "narrow down" what you intended based on what words in the dictionary could possibly match your number sequence.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Task</h2>
	<p>Write a T9 word function in the language of your choice with the following signature:</p>
	<pre name="code" class="php">
/**
 * Gets all possible words for a given number sequence typed on a standard
 * telephone 10-digit keypad. Gets ALL letter combinations and not just
 * those which are actual words (which would require a separate dictionary
 * lookup).
 *
 * Characters that do not correspond with a letter will be ignored.
 *
 * @param int|string numberSequence
 *
 * @return array An array of unique lowercase string word possibilities
 *               given the number sequence.
 */
function getPossibleWords(numberSequence)
{
	// Implement me :)
